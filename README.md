# Welcome to the Spotify Ad Skipper :D

## No more Spotify ads to listen to! Runs on CLI!

### Steps:
- Simply download the shell script and store it in a directory most convinient to you
- Run the script by typing this in your terminal: ./spotify.sh

And...that's it! Just let it run in your background and whenever you use the Spotify app on your computer it should quit Spotify immediately once it detects and advertisement, re-open it for you, and then play the next song available in your playlist that you were on!
