# Welcome to the Spotify Ad Skipper (SAS) :D

## No more Spotify ads to listen to! Runs on CLI!
## Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwXlkJedtg

### Steps:
#### - Simply download the shell script and store it in a directory most convinient to you (ex. downloads folder)
#### - Then go to that directory in the terminal
#### - Now run the script by typing this: ./spotify.sh

#### And...that's it! Just let it run in your background and whenever you use the Spotify app on your computer it should quit Spotify immediately once it detects and advertisement, re-open it for you, and then play the next song available in your playlist that you were on! Make sure that if you want to quit Spotify once and for all, stop the script first, otherwise it will reopen Spotify for you lol

#### Disclaimer: This only works if you have the Spotify App and you own an Apple computer because I used osascript which only works for macOS

### Backstory:
#### As a third year college student who loves playing music daily, I prefer not to have Spotify Premium Subscription. Therefore, as a student who happens to be studying computer science and learned about shell scripts, I decided to make it a goal for me to make my own Spotify Ad Skipper, haha! And so as I lay in bed recovering from a wisdom tooth surgery just yesterday, I decided to make this because I have nothing else to do. March 20, 2025
