# Welcome to the Spotify Ad Skipper (SAS) :D

## No more Spotify ads to listen to! Runs on CLI!

### Steps:
#### - Simply download the shell script and store it in a directory most convinient to you
#### - Run the script by typing this in your terminal: ./spotify.sh

#### Disclaimer: This only works if you have the Spotify App and you own an Apple computer because I used osascript which only works for macOS

#### And...that's it! Just let it run in your background and whenever you use the Spotify app on your computer it should quit Spotify immediately once it detects and advertisement, re-open it for you, and then play the next song available in your playlist that you were on!

### Backstory:
#### As a third year college student who loves playing music daily, when I asked my parents for a Spotify Premium, they told me Premium will drain my money and they are right. Therefore, as a student who happens to be studying computer science and learned about shell scripts, I decided to make it a goal for me to make my own Spotify Ad Skipper, haha!
